# Concurrent Set

A collection of elegant Java 8 implementations of linked-list-based concurrent 
set. The algorithms are described in the book *The Art of Multiprocessor 
Programming* by Maurice Herlihy and Nir Shavit ([ISBN 978-0-12-370591-4](
https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-art-of-multiprocessor-programming/herlihy/978-0-12-370591-4)).
This project contains implementations based on:
* Coarse-Grained Synchronization (§ 9.4)
* Fine-Grained Synchronization (§ 9.5)
* Optimistic Synchronization (§ 9.6)
* Lazy Synchronization (§ 9.7)
* Non-Blocking Synchronization (§ 9.8)
